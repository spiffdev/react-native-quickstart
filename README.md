# README #

This repository contains a pristine boilerplate with recommended settings for a new React Native application. It is intended to 
be forked and used as a starting point for new applications. Any tweaks to configuration can then be pulled from upstream if required.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Set up your environment for React Native development: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
* Fork the repository
* Run 'yarn start' to run the project in your new repo.
    * Metro provides the option to run on a configured device once the project is running. Check the console output for more information.
    * Alternatively, you may also explicitly run the project on a device using the following command: `yarn android` or `yarn ios`.
    * See more information about running the project here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device
* From that point on you may build out the application you need.

### Helpful React Native concepts ###

* Design: While React allows you to use html tags, React Native uses its own prebuilt components. See the documentation for more information: https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis
* Publishing: The process is much the same as for typical native applications. See the documentation for more information.
    * Android: https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android
    * iOS: https://reactnative.dev/docs/publishing-to-app-store

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Ensure any changes are very targeted and do not affect the boilerplate too much. (Consider the impact on other projects that may be using this boilerplate.)
